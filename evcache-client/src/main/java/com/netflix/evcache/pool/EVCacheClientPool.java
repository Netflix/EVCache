/**
 * An EVCacheClientPool represents a pool or {@link EVCacheClient} instances.
 * A Pool is associated with an Application Name (a.k.a app). Each app is a grouping of EVCache servers to.
 * If this pool is zone based then each {@link EVCacheClient} is associated with a zone.
 * Thus a zone based app will have a cluster of servers for each zone.
 *
 * EX : An app which stores customer data having a name EVCACHE_CUST in AWS availability zones
 * us-east-1a and us-east-1b  with 3 servers in each zone will be as below
 * <pre>
 *                                 EVCAHCE_CUST

 * Similarly, Server 4,5,6 form a cluster in zone us-east-1b and the data will be sharded across them.
 * The data is replicated among the 2 zones.
